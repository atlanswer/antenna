## Introduction

### Motivation

#### MIMO systems and mutual coupling

More new radio (NR) frequency bands are commercially used in 5G MIMO systems, increasing the number of antennas on the 5G mobile terminal.

It has been proven that the MIMO systems could effectively multiply the channel capacities, but the mutual couplings or correlations would deteriorate the throughput rate of the mobile terminals[^1].
